# üç± Deli Swap - Normie Summary

## What is Deli Swap?

Deli Swap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that supercharges your trading and liquidity providing experience. Built on top of Uniswap v4, we've added powerful features that automatically convert trading fees into BMX tokens and distribute them back to liquidity providers.

## üéØ Why Choose Deli Swap?

### For Traders

- **Low fees**: Benefit from efficient liquidity pools
- **Better prices**: Access both concentrated and simple liquidity pools
- **Seamless experience**: Trade any token pair with wBLT

### For Liquidity Providers

- **Automatic BMX rewards**: Your share of trading fees is converted to BMX tokens by keepers
- **Daily distributions**: Receive your BMX rewards every 24 hours (streamed)
- **Extra incentives**: Earn additional reward tokens on top of BMX
- **Flexible options**: Choose between two pool types based on your strategy

## üèä Two Ways to Provide Liquidity

### 1. Concentrated Liquidity Pools (Advanced)

Perfect for experienced LPs who want to maximize capital efficiency:

- Set custom price ranges for your liquidity
- Earn higher returns when prices stay in your range
- Ideal for stable pairs or when you have strong price predictions
- Fees range from 0.01% to 2.5% based on pool configuration

### 2. Simple x\*y=k Pools (Easy)

Great for beginners or "set and forget" liquidity providers:

- No need to manage price ranges
- Your liquidity is always earning fees
- Works just like classic Uniswap v2 pools
- Pool creators set fees (minimum 0.1%)

## üí∞ How Rewards Work

### Trading Fees ‚Üí BMX Tokens

Every trade on Deli Swap generates fees. Here's what happens next:

1. **Fees are collected** from each swap in wBLT
2. **97% converts to BMX** when enough fees accumulate (keepers handle this)
3. **BMX streams to you** over 24 hours starting 2 days later
4. **Claim anytime** - your rewards accumulate until you're ready

### The 3-Day Pipeline

To ensure stable and predictable rewards:

- **Day 1**: Fees are collected from trading, if threshold is meet then fees are used to buyback BMX
- **Day 2**: System holds your BMX rewards
- **Day 3**: BMX rewards stream to liquidity providers over 24 hours

For example: Monday's fees ‚Üí Stream on Wednesday

## üó≥Ô∏è Governance & Voting

### Your Voice Matters

When you provide liquidity and earn BMX, you can stake it to receive sbfBMX tokens - your voting power in the protocol. Every week, sbfBMX holders decide how to distribute the 3% protocol revenue share (in addition to revenue allocations from other products).

### How Voting Works

1. **Weekly Cycles**: New voting periods start every Tuesday
2. **Your Power**: 1 sbfBMX = 1 vote; sbfBMX includes your staked multiplier points
3. **Flexible Participation**: Vote manually each week or use auto-vote
4. **Distribution**: Winning vote weight determines how much goes to the Safety Module and how much is distributed to single stakers (weekly streaming)

### Auto-Vote Feature

Too busy to vote every week? Enable auto-vote:

- Your votes automatically support your previous choices
- Maintains your voting power without weekly management
- System checks your balance each week and adjusts accordingly

## üåü Unique Benefits

### Range-Aware Rewards

Only active liquidity earns rewards:

- Concentrated pools: Rewards when price is in your range
- Simple pools: Always in range, always earning

### Multi-Token Incentives

Beyond BMX rewards:

- Pools can receive additional reward tokens
- 7-day streaming for smooth distribution
- Stack multiple reward streams
- **Important**: Extra token rewards must be claimed before unsubscribing/transferring liquidity otherwise they will be forfeited

## üìà The BMX Advantage

BMX is the lifeblood of Deli Swap:

- **Earned by providing liquidity**: The more you provide, the more you earn
